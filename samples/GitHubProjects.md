# GitHub Projects

Below are known GitHub projects that use a WinGet configuration file that one can use to setup their environment for building the project. The [convention for the configuration file](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/configuration/create#file-naming-convention) is to name it `configuration.winget` and place it in a `.config` directory in the root of the project.
The projects are listed in alphabetical order by their GitHub repository identifier. The list is not exhaustive and is meant to be a starting point for finding projects that use a WinGet configuration file. If you know of any other projects that use a WinGet configuration file, feel free to add them to the list.
