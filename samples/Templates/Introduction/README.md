This directory contains different [Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/) (WinGet) [Configuration files](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/configuration/) that will be used for setting up your device for a specific software development language. These files are designed specifically for providing an introduction to software development, creating the default *Hello World* project, without having to focus on understanding the complexities of what needs to be installed, and how should it be configured.

## Language specific folders (Naming Standard)
Each folder in this folder will be labeled with the name of the Software Development language it is associated with. If the language is inclusive of another language, it'll be seperated by a decimal. If the language contains a version specific release that needs to be accounted for, then the version will be considered as the language.

### Example:
* .\JavaScript.NodeJS
* .\Python3.11
