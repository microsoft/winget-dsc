The WinGet Configuration Files that are contained within the *Android Apps* folder are provided as an initial starting location to building Android applications with a specific software development language. This section will provide you with guidance on what you need, and how to install the software and dependency requirements. Allowing you to focus on learning/experiencing the software development language of your choice.

## Language specific folders
Each folder in this folder will be labeled with the name of the Software Development language it is associated with. If the language is inclusive of another language, it'll be seperated by a decimal. If the language contains a version specific release that needs to be accounted for, then the version will be considered as the language.

### Example:
* .\JavaScript.NodeJS
* .\C++
