# Install React Native for Windows support in Visual Studio Code

This folder contains [Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/) (WinGet) [Configuration Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/configuration/) for setting up a React Native for Windows development environment using Visual Studio Code.

When run, the configuration file will install the following:

- Visual Studio Code (recommended editor)
- Node.js LTS (provides npm)
- Windows Terminal
- React Native Tools extension for VS Code

If anything is already installed, the configuration file will skip that item.

This configuration file is based on the [React Native for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/javascript/react-native-for-windows) Microsoft Learn tutorial.
