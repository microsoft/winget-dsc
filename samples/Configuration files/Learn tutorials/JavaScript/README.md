# Install Node.js on Windows

This folder contains a [Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/) (WinGet) [Configuration File](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/configuration/) ([_learn_nodejs.winget_](./learn_nodejs.winget)) that will work with the WinGet command line interface (`winget configure --file [path: learn_nodejs.winget]`) or can be run directly by double-clicking on the file.

When run, the [learn_nodejs.winget](./learn_nodejs.winget) file will install the following list of applications:

- Git for Windows
- Visual Studio Code
- NVM for Windows

If anything is already installed, the configuration file will skip that item.

This configuration file is based on the [Install Node.js on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows) Microsoft Learn tutorial.
