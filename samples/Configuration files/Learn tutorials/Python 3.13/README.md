# Understanding WinGet Configuration Files

This folder contains a [Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/) (WinGet) [Configuration File](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/configuration/) (_learn_python.winget_) that will work with the WinGet command line interface (`winget configure --file [path: learn_python.winget]`) or can be run directly by double-clicking on the file.

When run, the `learn_python.winget` file will install the following list of applications:
