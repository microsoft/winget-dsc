# Get started using Python on Windows for beginners

This folder contains a [Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/) (WinGet) [Configuration File](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/configuration/) (_learn_python.winget_) that will work with the WinGet command line interface (`winget configure --file [path: learn_python.winget]`) or can be run directly by double-clicking on the file.

When run, the [learn_python.winget](./learn_python.winget) file will install the following list of applications:

- Python 3.13
- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio Code extension for Python

If anything is already installed, the configuration file will skip that item.

This configuration file is based on the [Get started using Python on Windows for beginners](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/python/beginners) Microsoft Learn tutorial.
