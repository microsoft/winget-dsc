.SYNOPSIS
  One-shot "fix it" script: turn on `winget configure` on a machine where
  it isn't working yet.

.DESCRIPTION
  This is the single remediation path for the three failure modes that
  `assert-winget-configure.ps1` detects. The CmdPal extension's red
  "winget configure is unavailable" banner launches this script; humans
  can also run it by hand. Keeping the logic here (not duplicated in C#)
  means any future tweak -- e.g. dropping the VCRedist install once
  AppInstaller ships it transitively -- only has to happen in one place.

  What it does, in order:

    1. Self-elevates via `Start-Process -Verb RunAs` if not already admin.
       `winget configure --enable` flips a machine-wide flag and needs
       elevation; `Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64` likewise.
    2. Runs `winget configure --enable` -- the supported first-party way
       to turn the `configure` subcommand on. Ignores "already enabled"
       errors so re-runs are a safe no-op.
    3. Installs `Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64` -- the PackageManager
       configure path transitively depends on the 2015+ x64 redistributable
       (AppInstaller does not always pull it in on its own). Skipped when
       already present.
    4. Re-runs the assert to confirm the fix took.

.PARAMETER NoElevate
  Internal switch used by the self-elevation path to avoid infinite
  re-elevation loops. Do not set by hand.

.PARAMETER SkipVCRedist
  Skip step (3). Useful once Microsoft ships a configure path that no
  longer needs VCRedist -- flip this on and we keep the rest of the
  remediation.

.EXAMPLE
  # From a normal PowerShell -- triggers a UAC prompt, then runs.
  .\enable-winget-configure.ps1

.EXAMPLE
  # From an already-elevated PowerShell (e.g. inside a VM bootstrap).
  .\enable-winget-configure.ps1 -NoElevate
