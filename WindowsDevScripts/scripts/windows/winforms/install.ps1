.SYNOPSIS
  Apply the WinForms winget DSC configuration on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
  This script is a thin CI/dev shim. The core artifact for the WinForms flow
  is `configuration.winget` in this directory — a winget DSC configuration
  that declaratively installs the .NET 10 SDK (which includes the Windows
  Desktop targeting pack used by `UseWindowsForms=true` projects).

  The shim exists only to:
    * apply the DSC config with retry (hosted-runner networks are flaky),
    * rehydrate PATH in the current session so later CI steps see `dotnet`,
    * verify `dotnet` resolves, and
    * emit `INSTALL_OK: winforms` for the test harness.
